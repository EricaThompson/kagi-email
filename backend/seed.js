Accurately identifying products in varied lighting conditions\n2. Maintaining an updated database of product information across retailers\n3. Developing algorithms that can provide genuinely personalized recommendations\n\nProbably not useful anymore, but keeping for reference. If we ever pivot more toward consumer retail tech, some elements of this concept might be worth revisiting, particularly the visual search component. The market analysis I did also revealed some interesting insights about shopping behavior that could inform our current product decisions."

        "body": "Capture of that app idea I had last month about the augmented reality shopping assistant. I've been doing some additional research, and while the core concept still seems innovative, the technical implementation would be more complex than I initially thought.\n\n\nThe main challenges would be:\n1. Accurately identifying products in varied lighting conditions\n2. Maintaining an updated database of product information across retailers\n3. Developing algorithms that can provide genuinely personalized recommendations\n\nProbably not useful anymore, but keeping for reference. If we ever pivot more toward consumer retail tech, some elements of this concept might be worth revisiting, particularly the visual search component. The market analysis I did also revealed some interesting insights about shopping behavior that could inform our current product decisions."
